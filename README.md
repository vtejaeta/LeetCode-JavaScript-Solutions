# LeetCode-JavaScript-Solutions

## Overview
Hello ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my repository of LeetCode Solutions using JavaScript. I often solve LeetCode problems, which helps me to write more optimised and efficient code. It mainly focuses on our intuition to approach towards any problem.

### How to solve these problems
1. If you wish to solve these problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), find the problem number through the readme of the problem folder and try it in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
2. Else clone the project using the command `git clone https://github.com/vtejaeta/LeetCode-JavaScript-Solutions.git`
3. Move into the file directory you wish to run using `cd {folder_name}`. Read the problem statement through the readme file and try to solve it.
4. If you wish to see my solution, open the file `{folder_name}.js` within problem folder.
